# Num

Num is a trait for primitive datatypes that can be stored in a Tensor. More types will be added, but it can not be implemented outside the crate.

- f32 (32 bit float)
- u8 (8 bit unsigned char)

## Unsigned 

Unsigned is a subset of Num, for unsigned integral types, ie whole numbers. This is generally used to represent class labels.

- u8
