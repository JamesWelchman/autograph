# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning refers to algorithms that solve problems by iteratively improving until they converge to a solution. Unlike handcrafted logic, such algorithms scale to "Big Data", potentially with billions of individually tuned parameters. Typically, such models separate datapoints into several classes, known as classification. This may be supervised, which means that some of the datapoints have been labeled by hand, or unsupervised, where the algorithm is not provided labeled datapoints.
